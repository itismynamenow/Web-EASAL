# Web-EASAL client

This is a copy of code for my project which moved [EASAL](https://bitbucket.org/geoplexity/easal) (C++ geometry/chemistry software) to web. I moved it here from Bitbucket closed repo to keep all my projects in single place. For safety reasons I didn't move server code and included client only.

## Features

* Usage of existing C++ with very little modifications (because all data goes through Mongo DB)
* Usage of custom 3D render made with OpenGL 2.0
* Replication of huge portion of desktop EASAL features
